gravel is a bunch of rocks!

does everything i need `rocq makefile` to do, but without the horrors :-)

# install

`git clone`, then `cabal install`

# usage

- navigate to the directory where the `_CoqProject` file is
- `gravel` will build all the rocq files, using whatever `rocq` is in `PATH`
- `gravel clean` will remove all artifacts
